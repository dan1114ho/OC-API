  <h2>Discover what Open Collective can do for your organization</h2>

</div>

<p>Open Collective makes it easy for your organization to donate to many different collectives around the world. If they don't have a legal entity (like most meetups, open source projects and other citizen initiatives), our network of host organizations can host them to provide you with a proper receipt or invoice for your books.</p>

<p>
  <b>🤝 Trust</b><br />
  The only way a collective can get any money out is by filing an expense publicly. This level of transparency ensures that the money is used for the intended purpose set by the community.
</p>

<p>
  <b>📈 Consolidated Monthly Reporting</b><br />
  In one monthly email, get an overview of all the collectives that you are supporting, how much money they raised and how much they spent during the month per category.
</p>

<p>
  <b>✉️ Consolidated Monthly Invoices</b><br />
  Make it easy for your finance department with consolidated monthly invoices. You will find them on your transactions page: <a href="https://opencollective.com/{{collective.slug}}/transactions">https://opencollective.com/{{collective.slug}}/transactions</a>
</p>

<p>
  <b>👩🏻‍💻 Enable your employees to donate</b><br />
  You can save a credit card on file and enable the members of your organization to donate up to a certain amount per month.
</p>

<p>
  <b>💵 Create a matching fund</b><br />
  Automatically double the donations to collectives in a certain category (contact us for more info and to set this up).
</p>

<p>If there is a collective that you would love to support but that is not on Open Collective yet, ask them to create an open collective, we will speed up their approval process.</p>

<p>If there is anything else we can do to help, feel free to reach out. You can also directly schedule a call (<a href="http://calendly.com/piamancini/call">calendly.com/piamancini/call</a>), email me or <a href="https://slack.opencollective.com">join us on our Slack</a>. </p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Pía, and the Open Collective Team</p>
