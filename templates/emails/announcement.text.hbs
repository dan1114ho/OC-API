Subject: Updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

Dear {{recipient.firstName}},

Hi!
{{/if}}

Just a brief (but important) note to share our updated Terms of Service (https://opencollective.com/tos) and Privacy Policy (https://opencollective.com/privacypolicy).

Transparency is a core value of Open Collective. And legal documents (with legalese) are often opposite of transparent - they are hard to parse and hard to follow, unless you are a lawyer. We have tried our best to draft them in plain terms and added clarifications wherever we felt it was necessary.

Please read both documents carefully and if you have questions or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to contact us (hello@opencollective.com) or comment on this Github issue (https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/issues/322). Open Collective is a community and the rules that organize it are always open to a conversation.

– Open Collective
