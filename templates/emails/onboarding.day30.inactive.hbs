Subject: How can I help your collective?

{{> header}}

<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>We noticed that you created a collective a while ago and we were wondering if youâ€™d like help setting it up.</p>

<p>Starting a project is not easy and we understand it can be overwhelming to manage it.</p>

<p>We believe that collaborating in a transparent environment is the key for the success of your projects. Try <a href="https://opencollective.com/{{collective.slug}}/expenses/new">uploading your expenses</a> and sharing your mission with others so that contributors can get a better idea of why you need their support.</p>

<p>Let us know if you need any help setting things up, we are here to help your collective succeed.</p>

<p>Feel free to schedule a call (<a href="http://calendly.com/piamancini/call">calendly.com/piamancini/call</a>), email me or <a href="https://slack.opencollective.com">join us on our Slack</a>. We would love to know your story.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>PÃ­a, and the Open Collective Team</p>
