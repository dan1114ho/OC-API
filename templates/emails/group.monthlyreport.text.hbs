Hi {{recipient.firstName}}!

February was short and sweet (and so is this email)! Collectives as a whole had their best month yet and we can’t be happier.

As usual, let’s start with your monthly stats:

Balance: {{{currency group.stats.balance currency=group.currency}}} (+{{{currency group.stats.totalDonations currency=group.currency}}}{{#if group.stats.totalExpenses}}, {{{currency group.stats.totalExpenses currency=group.currency}}}{{/if}}) 
{{group.stats.backers.lastMonth}} backers (+{{group.stats.backers.new}}{{#if group.stats.backers.lost}}, -{{group.stats.backers.lost}}{{/if}}) 


# New Related Collectives

{{#each relatedGroups}}
{{publicUrl}}
{{{capitalize mission}}}

{{/each}}

# Expenses

{{#each group.expenses}}
- {{{moment createdAt format="MM/DD"}}} {{{currency netAmountInGroupCurrency currency=currency}}} {{description}} [{{toLowerCase status}}]
{{else}}
No expense submitted. 
{{/each}}

Go to {{@root.group.publicUrl}}/expenses to submit a new expense.

# Changelog

Sell Tickets: We are rolling out the first release of a feature to sell event tickets on your Open Collective page! The goal is to avoid collectives the pain of using multiple platforms when putting together an event. http://opencollective.com/brusselstogether/events/meetup-2

Npm-postinstall: A module to prompt your users to donate to your collective after `npm install`: https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective-postinstall). There has been a lively conversation on twitter about it: https://twitter.com/_developit/status/836377502939557888. We are looking for someone to try it. Are you interested?

Backer/Sponsor Widget: If you are supporting a collective (or many collectives!), you can add a banner to your website to showcase them. https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/wiki/Website-widget

Welcome Alanna to Open Collective:
We are super excited to have Alanna (Enspiral, loomio, Co-budget among other amazing projects) as a core contributor on Open Collective. She will be reaching out to many of you to chat and write about your work and your collectives. She wrote a great blog post about why she came on board: Being a circle in a world made for triangles https://medium.com/open-collective/being-a-circle-in-a-world-made-for-triangles-bc434d823a79#.93kn2xcxn


# Ideas on how to spend your collective’s money

Technical writer for a monthly newsletter: Healthiest communities are built around frequent communication. We know it's a lot of work to keep it up but it helps to keep your contributors updated and engaged. If you want help drafting a monthly newsletter, we have a technical writer (who currently writes Node JS newsletter) available to help for a small fee. She'll look through your GitHub repos, summarize changes and any new issues to draft an update to your contributors. Ping us to get started.
Get together IRL! If your team members don’t need the extra cash, or they have a company paying them to work on OSS what better way of spending the money than organizing a weekend together somewhere around the globe! 🌎 🌍 🌏

# OpenCollective meetup
If you are in NYC, come join us for a drink 🍻 next Wednesday (March 8th) at 7pm at the Swift Hiberian Lounge. RSVP on our new events page 😊 https://opencollective.com/opencollective/events/meetup-1

# Don’t forget!
Let us know if you want to receive an email when your collective receives a new donation or someone files an expense! We are very mindful of everyone’s inbox so we don’t do this by default.
