Hi {{recipient.firstName}}!

We hope you had a great start of the year! We are grateful and humbled by how much support the collectives are getting. <3

As usual, let’s start with your monthly stats:

Balance: {{{currency group.stats.balance currency=group.currency}}} (+{{{currency group.stats.totalDonations currency=group.currency}}}{{#if group.stats.totalExpenses}}, {{{currency group.stats.totalExpenses currency=group.currency}}}{{/if}}) 
{{group.stats.backers.lastMonth}} backers (+{{group.stats.backers.new}}{{#if group.stats.backers.lost}}, -{{group.stats.backers.lost}}{{/if}})

# Changelog

Request Money:
Sometimes you want to send a backer or a sponsor a specific link for a donation, or you want to do a special subscription deal or sell tickets to a meetup. We released a new feature to generate a specific URL for this and you can find it in your transactions page: {{group.publicUrl}}/transactions

We’ve changed the way your backers are charged:
We now charge recurring monthly subscriptions on 1st of every month (only for new recurring donations).

The goal is to help you better manage your budget. You will now start the month with a minimum budget that will get improved with any new donations. This will also enable us in the future to charge a single payment for multiple monthly donations from the same user and reduce transaction fees.


# Featured Collective

We created a collective https://opencollective.com/NoMuslimBan to raise money to support #NoMuslimBan and shared an email address (expenses@NoMuslimBan.opencollective.com) to reimburse any immigration-related receipts. First use of that money: send 10 pizzas to the lawyers working hard and late into the night at JFK. Kudos to the delivery guy who made it happen amidst the chaos!! You can help us use the money by asking anyone who took part of the protest to file the expenses they had to the collective. A lot of people want to help cover them!

# Don't forget

Let us know if you want to receive an email when your collective receives a new donation or someone files an expense! We are very mindful of everyone’s inbox so we don’t do this by default.
