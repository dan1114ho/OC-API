# Changelog

You probably noticed that we redesigned your collectiveâ€™s page. We decided to put the expenses and donations at the top to emphasis the financial transparency aspect of Open Collective and embrace the fact that in order to do great things together, we need money to fund them. We wrote about it here: https://medium.com/open-collective/meet-the-open-source-design-collective-96e81261f76#.neu5eimgr
