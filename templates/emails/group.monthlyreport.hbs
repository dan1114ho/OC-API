<h2>Changelog</h2>
<p>
You will likely notice some changes to your collective page: now the contributors counter includes backers, sponsors as well as core contributors. We believe that everyone has something to contribute and we should all be acknowledged as such. 
</p><p>
We will keep iterating on the collective page for the next couple of weeks and we looooooove your feedback & ideas! We can‚Äôt know what‚Äôs useful for you if you don‚Äôt share it with us. Please send us anything you think relevant or silly to support@opencollective.com and/or #user-feedback channel on https://slack.opencollective.com. We will be very thankful and send appreciative stickers your way!</p>
