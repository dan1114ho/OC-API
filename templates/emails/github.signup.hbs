<p>Dear {{firstName}},</p>
{{else}}
<p>Hi!</p>
{{/if}}

<p>Thanks for signing up on Open Collective! Your collective has been created: <a href="{{config.host.website}}/{{group.slug}}">{{group.name}}</a>.</p>

<p>While you wait for approval to start receiving donations, here's a quick guide to customize your collective and make the most out of it: </p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Make your collective your own.</strong> <a href="{{config.host.website}}/login">Login</a> and hover over elements to edit them. </li>

<li><strong>Add backers/sponsors to Github/Website.</strong> We'll submit a PR to your README to add backers & sponsors. Instructions to add your backers to your website <a href="https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/wiki/Website-banner">here</a>.

<li><strong>Start tracking expenses.</strong> Submit expenses on <a href="{{config.host.website}}/{{group.slug}}/expenses">{{config.host.website}}/{{group.slug}}/expenses</a> so others can see your costs. It helps to raise awareness (and later, money).

<li><strong>Spread the word.</strong> You can <a href="{{config.host.website}}/{{group.slug}}/connect/twitter">connect your Twitter account to your collective</a> and automatically thank your backers. You can also <a href="https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/wiki/Slack-and-Gitter">connect your Slack channel</a>.

</ol>

<p>Btw, if you are looking for inspiration, check out some of the <a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource">other successful collectives</a> and see how they are spending the money they have raised.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
