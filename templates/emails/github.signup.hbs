<p>Hi!</p>
{{/if}}

<p> Thanks for signing up on Open Collective! Your collective is now live: <a href="{{config.host.website}}/{group.slug}">{{group.name}}</a>. While you wait for approval to start receiving donations, here's a quick guide to make the most out of it: </p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Make your collective your own.</strong> Login and hover over elements to edit them. </li>

<li><strong>Add backers/sponsors to Github/Website.</strong> We'll submit a PR to your README to add backers & sponsors. Instructions to add your backers to a website here (LINK).

<li><strong>Start tracking expenses.</strong> Submit expenses so others can see your costs. It helps to raise awareness (and later, money).

<li><strong>Spread the word.</strong> If you have a twitter account, you can connect it to your collective and automatically thank your backers. <a href="https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/wiki/Twitter">Instructions</a>

</ol>

<p>Btw, if you are looking for inspiration, check out some of the <a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource">other successful collectives</a> and see how they are spending the money they have raised.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
