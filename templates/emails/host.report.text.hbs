Hi {{recipient.firstName}}!

Sorry, previous report sent yesterday was miscalculating the total amount received on your bank account in June. This numbers is the net amount received for all the collectives that you are hosting plus (and not minus) your host fees.
This has been corrected in this report. We also took the opportunity to make the summary table a bit more clear.
Sorry again for the inconvenience and don't hesitate to reply to this email if you have any questions or feedback to make this report better!
