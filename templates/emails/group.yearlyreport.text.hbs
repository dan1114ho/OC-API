Hi {{recipient.firstName}}!

2016 reaches its end 🎉. Let's be frank, we can't wait for this year to be over 😱.

It's been a heck of a year all over the world, but as we say: "never let a good crisis go to waste".

Crisis are opportunities to change, opportunities to reinvent the way we live and work together, for the better 🌱

We believe in communities. We believe that they are the best positioned to give everyone the opportunity to learn and give back to the world 🌎.

To enable those communities to sustain themselves and thrive, we need a new form of association that would be open and transparent by design. We call them "open collectives". In 2016, we created 155 of them and together, they already have a yearly budget of more than $350k 💰💰💰.

We would like to thank you for the contributions that you made this year to help us build this future 🙏.
