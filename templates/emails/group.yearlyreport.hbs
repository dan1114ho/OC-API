Hi {{recipient.firstName}}!

<p>
2016 reaches its end ðŸŽ‰. Let's be frank, we can't wait for this year to be over.
</p>

<p>
It's been a heck of a year. But as we say: "never waste a crisis".
Crisis are opportunities to change, opportunities to reinvent the way we want to live and work together, for the better ðŸŒ±
</p>

<p>
We believe that the world is moving away from the old top down hierarchies, from zero sum game markets that demanded us to compete with each others.
We believe that we need to reinvent how we work together, how our communities can give everyone the opportunity to join and contribute their talent in a bottom up fashion. To achieve that, we believe that we need a new form of association for this new bottom up world ðŸŒŽ. We call them Open Collectives.
</p>

<p>
We would like to thank you for the contributions that you made this year to build this future.
