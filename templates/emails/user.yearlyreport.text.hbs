Hi {{collective.name}}!

{{year}} is already ending 🎉. That was fast!

We believe in communities. They make us strong and give everyone the opportunity to learn and give back to the world 🌎.

To enable those communities to sustain themselves and thrive, we need a new form of association that would be open and transparent by design. We call them "open collectives". In {{year}}, {{platformStats.totalCollectives}} collectives joined our community. Together, we already have a yearly budget of more than {{{currency platformStats.totalAnnualBudget currency="USD"}}} 💰💰💰.

We would like to thank you for the contributions that you made this year to help us build this future 🙏.

In {{year}} you have contributed a total of {{stats.totalDonationsString}} across {{stats.totalCollectives}} {{{pluralize "collective" n=stats.totalCollectives}}}:

{{#each hosts}}
{{name}}
  {{#each collectives}}
  {{{currency totalDonations currency=currency}}} to {{name}} https://opencollective.com/{{slug}}
  {{/each}}
